# Dotfiles Project

## Overview
This repository contains my personal configuration files for development and specially for **DevOps**, and automated setup script for macOS, with plans to expand to Linux and Windows.

## Installation
To set up your macOS environment, run the following command:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nalwisdi/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```
This command will:
- Install `brew` package manager (if not already installed).
- Install my preferred CLI and GUI tools.
- Clone the repository.
- Stow configurations automatically.

## My Setup Tools (macOS)
### Productivity Tools
- **Raycast**: Alternative for Spotlight with advanced capabilities (Free version is more than enough).
- **Rectangle**: Window management via shortcuts.
- **Stats**: System resource monitoring (in menubar).
- **Maccy**: Clipboard manager (in menubar).
- **KeepingYouAwake**: Prevents system sleep (in menubar).
- **CleanMyMac**: Advanced System maintenance and optimization (Paid).
- **AlDente Pro**: Customizes charging limits to extend battery health (Paid).

### Main CLI Tools
- **lf**: Advanced file manager.
- **nvim**: Customized version with support to many IDE features (a fork from nvchad).
- **tmux**: Allows multiple terminal sessions in one window with persistent sessions.
